            <ul>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl combine butter, garlic, 
                    and dried herbs and set aside. Season steaks generously with salt, pepper,
                    and garlic powder on both sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place skillet over medium-high heat and drizzle with oil. Sear steaks for
                    2-3 minutes one each side until nice and browned. Transfer to a plate and
                    set aside. 
                </li>
                <li>        
                    Add potatoes to the skillet, season generously with salt, pepper, and garlic
                    powder and saute 3-5 minutes until browned. Push potatoes to one side of 
                    the pan and return steaks to the other side of the pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer to oven and cook for 15-20 minutes until potatoes are fork-tender 
                    and steak is cooked to your preferred doneness.
                </li>
                <li>    
                    Immediately after removing from oven, place a dollop of the garlic butter
                    on each steak and the rest on the potatoes and let it melt over the food
                    before stirring the potatoes to coat in butter and then topping with 
                    chopped thyme and parsley before serving. 
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p id="ing-title">Notes</p>
        <p>
            I've tried this with several cuts of beef and all have worked out to 
            be delicious. I just look for the right size - steaks small enough
            in a 12-inch skillet and still cram a bunch of potatoes in there 
            (usually steaks that are about 4-6 inches long), and a decent price. 
            The steaks should be about 1 inch thick (I recommend staying away
            from very thin cuts as they will cook too quickly and end up overdone 
            at the end!). <br>
            Any oven-safe skillet will work but I highly recommend a cast-iron 
            pan because it is the best for getting that awesome sear on your steak.
